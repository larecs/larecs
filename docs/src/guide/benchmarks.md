The focused `entity_selection_benchmark.mojo` workload compares ordinary
full-world CPU execution with contiguous and disjoint 64-row selections in a
100,000-row world, a selected add/remove chain, and selected GPU execution when
an accelerator is available. On the Apple Metal development host used for the
1.0.0b2 work, one bounded run measured approximately 0.0253 ms for the 100k-row
CPU path, 0.0000664 ms for the contiguous selection, 0.000556 ms for 64 disjoint
single-row ranges, 0.00727 ms for the add/remove chain, and 0.379 ms for the GPU
selection. These are development measurements, not a cross-version historical
baseline; use the benchmark on target hardware for regression decisions.

## ECS operations

TODO: Tabular overview of the runtime cost of typical ECS operations.
See Arche's [benchmarks](https://mlange-42.github.io/arche/background/benchmarks/) for an example.

## Versus Array of Structs

The plots below show the iteration time per entity in the classical Position-Velocity example.
That is, iterate all entities with components `Position` and `Velocity`, and add velocity to position:

```mojo
position.x += velocity.x
position.y += velocity.y
```

The benchmark is performed with different amounts of "payload components",
where each of them has two `Float64` fields, just like `Position` and `Velocity`.
Further, the total number of entities is varied from 100 to 1 million.

Note that the benchmarks run in the Github CI, 
which uses very powerful hardware.
Particularly, the processors have 256MB of cache.
On a laptop or desktop computer with typically much less cache,
Larecs🌲 will outperform AoS for everything but the smallest setups.
